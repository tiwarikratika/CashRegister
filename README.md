<b> We all have struggled calculating the change after paying some bill</b>
This app is the solution to all of that calculation-headaches we get.

This app calculates the change after paying a bill amount in minimum number of notes.

I created this app using <b>Vanilla JS</b>

This app takes in input the bill amount and then then the amount of money given to pay that bill.
It then returns with the minimun number of notes required to return that change

Hope you like it :)
